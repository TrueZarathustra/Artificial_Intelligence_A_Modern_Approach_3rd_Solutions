2.1 
For example: at the T-th time step agent will choose greedy (minutely favorable) solution, even if it is not globally optimal

2.2
a - it's rational, cause there is no other agent, which can do better
b - yes, to remember the state and to avoid unneccesary movements
c-  yes, it can learn environment to choose optimal movement. It also can learn the possibility of clean->dirty transition to choose time interval for checking squares

2.3
a - false
b - false. In totally randomized environment with no consistent laws none of the agents can be rational, but we also can say that in this case EVERY agent will be rational
c - similar to b. In some environments every (and none at the same time) of agents rational
d - true
e - true, if function can be formalized somehow 
f - true, for example, in trivial cases when there is only one possible action for an agent
g - true
h - false
i - false

2.4
Playing soccer:
Performance - win game, maximize own goals, minimize foreigh goals
Environment - other players, field, ball, referee
Actuators - devices for movement and kicking ball
Sensors - cameras, touch sensors, accelerometers

2.5
agent - an essence which receives data from sensors, handle them and react with actuating mechanisms
agent function - a function, that defines how an agent acts in different situations
agent programm - a programm which implements agent's function
rationality - an ability to act such as the expected result of action will be as good as possible
autonomy - a possibility to act without external help
reflex agent - an agent whose actions depend only from current percept
model-based agent - an agent who has an model of the world (knowledge of how his action will affect the world state)
goal-based agent - an agent who choose actions in a way to reach the goal
utility-based agent - an agent who try to maximize his performance
learning agent - an agent who changes his function based on his previous expirience

2.6
a - yes
b - yes
c - yes
d - 2^n
e - if an agent has a time limit for make an action - yes, else - no
